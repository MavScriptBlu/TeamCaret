# Changelog

Database and design decisions, newest first.

## 2026-10-05 · Schema sync

- ERD: added the CAR-30 event and ticket changes (`TICKET_REGISTRATION`, `Events` start/end times, `TicketsSold`, `IsActive`, `RowVersion`, `Venues.IsActive`, `Products.ProductType`), CAR-24's `OrderLines.ProductNameSnapshot`, and the `ADMIN` → `MEMBER` link from CAR-28. The ERD now renders as a diagram on GitHub.
- Schema doc: replaced the outdated hand-written SQL with pointers to the migrations, the ERD and the design docs.
- Lifecycle audit doc: updated the Member, Officer, Venue, Event and Ticket rows to match CAR-28 and CAR-30.

## 2026-10-04 · CAR-30 Event, ticket and venue schema

- Tickets are Products with `ProductType = 'Ticket'`; each admission is a `TicketRegistrations` row.
- `Events.TicketsSold` with a `CHECK` against `TicketCapacity` blocks overselling in the database.

## 2026-10-01 · CAR-28 Membership lifecycle

- Member status (Active/Expired/Inactive) is worked out from `IsActive` + `MemberExpiration`; `IsCurrent` removed.
- Member rows are never deleted; foreign keys into `Customers` and `Members` are `NO ACTION`.

## 2026-09-25 · CAR-24 Product soft delete

- "Delete" archives a product (`IsActive = 0`); officers can't hard-delete.
- Global query filter hides archived products; order history reads snapshots from `OrderLines`.
